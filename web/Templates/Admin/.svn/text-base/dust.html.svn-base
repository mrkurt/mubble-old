<p>There are a ton of buttons and links and such that just don't work in the admin interface.  
What you're looking at is the bare minimum required to get the site up and running.</p>
<p>Bug reports should be directed to <a href="mailto:support@mubble.net">support@mubble.net</a>.  
Only bugs that drastically affect the ability to publish content will be addressed.  Other feedback will be considered for
the "real" admin interface that should be released shortly before Duke Nukem Forever.
