http://www.newtonsoft.com/products/json/



Description:

The Json.NET API allows the simple and safe reading and writing of JSON objects from .NET. Using readers and writers, similar to .NET's XML API, Json.NET will be familiar to most .NET developers and makes passing messages between .NET and JavaScript a snap.



Instructions:

1. Extract Newtonsoft.Json.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.xml from the archive's /bin directory into your own applications.
 2. Add a reference to Newtonsoft.Json.dll within Visual Studio.NET to your project.
